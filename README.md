# Grin

### About
A Twine Horror Story Game developed by me using Twine 2 software.
It was inspired by Horror Visual Novel and RPG Maker Games such as Higurashi When They Cry and Ib.

### Story
There was a little boy who lived a normal, happy life in the cabin located near the woods with his dad and mom. However, the little boy dreamt of something...something strange. It felt like there was someone or something stalking him with a grin. Soon after, that nightmare would soon become a reality. Will he be able to escape alive? Or will he fearfully die?
